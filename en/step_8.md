## TextBox widget

**TextBox** widgets are used to let the user type in data - a bit like the GUI version of the `input()` function you may have used before. Here's how to add one:

- Add the `TextBox` widget to your import statement.

- Add a `TextBox` to the GUI:

    ```python
    my_name = TextBox(app)
    ```

- Run your code by pressing F5. You should see a small text box appear. There is a keyword parameter `width` which you can add if you wish to make the box wider.

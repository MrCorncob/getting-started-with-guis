## Picture widget

You can add pictures to your GUI, as long as they are in GIF format. Sadly, animated gifs will only display as stills.

- Find a picture in GIF format that you would like to use, or save an existing picture as a GIF. Save the picture in the same folder as your `gui_test.py` Python file.

- Add the `Picture` widget to your import statement.

- Add a `Picture` to the GUI:

    ```python
    my_cat = Picture(app, image="cat.gif")
    ```

- Press F5 to run iyour code. You should see your picture appear on the GUI.

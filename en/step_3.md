## What is a GUI?

GUI stands for Graphical User Interface and it is pronounced ***gooey***. 

If you have written Python programs before, all of your input and output will probably have been dealt with via text appearing on the screen or being typed in by the user. 

Adding a GUI to your program lets the user interact with it using buttons, drop downs, text boxes, menus and other familiar user interface controls.

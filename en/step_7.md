## TextBox widget

A `TextBox` widgets allows the user to type in data, a bit like the GUI version of Python's `input()` function, which you may have come across before. Here's how to add one a `TextBox`:

- Add the `TextBox` widget to your import statement.

- Add a `TextBox` to the GUI:

    ```python
    my_name = TextBox(app)
    ```

- Run your code by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd>. You should see a small text box appear. The widget has an optional keyword parameter `width`, which you can add if you wish to make the box wider.
